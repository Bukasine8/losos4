\# Losos4 Website 



> \*\*Design Intent:\*\* Create a premium, high-authority engineering consulting website for \*\*Losos4\*\* that communicates scale, precision, and trust. The visual language must feel engineered, deliberate, and powerful — not decorative. Every section flows seamlessly using \*\*diagonal dividers\*\*, with \*\*zero white gaps\*\*, no rounded corners, and disciplined motion throughout.

\## 1. Global Design System



\### Color Palette (Strict)



\* \*\*Primary Dark Blue (Almost Black):\*\* #070B1A (used for major backgrounds, hero, footer)

\* \*\*Deep Blue (Accent / Action):\*\* #0013DE (CTAs, links, focus states, motion highlights)

\* \*\*Bluish White (Base Light):\*\* #D8DEEC (primary background for light sections, cards)



> No additional colors. Gradients may only be tonal variations of these three.



---



\### Typography



\* \*\*Primary Font:\*\* Inter (variable)

\* \*\*Secondary / Technical Accent:\*\* Manrope or IBM Plex Sans



Hierarchy:



\* H1: Large, bold, tight tracking

\* H2: Strong, confident, authoritative

\* Body: Medium weight, generous line height



> All text must animate in on load (fade + subtle Y translation).



---



\### Motion Rules (Mandatory)



\* Every text element: \*\*loading animation\*\*

\* Every button: \*\*hover + click animation\*\*

\* Every UI component: \*\*loading + hover animation\*\*

\* Motion style: smooth, deliberate, professional

\* Use Framer Motion or equivalent



---



\### Section Dividers



\* Every section separated by \*\*diagonal cuts\*\*

\* No curves, no waves

\* Angles must feel architectural and precise

\* Dividers must overlap sections — \*\*no whitespace gaps\*\*
