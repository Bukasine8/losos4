Losos-4 Consultants Ltd. is an indigenous, multidisciplinary engineering consulting firm with roots in professional engineering practice spanning several decades. The firm was founded by Engr. Solomon A. T. Oni, a seasoned Mechanical Engineer, after more than 25 years of extensive experience working in reputable consulting and contracting engineering firms across Nigeria.

The company initially began operations as Losos-4 Consultants, a sole proprietorship, established to provide professional mechanical and electrical engineering consultancy services. As demand for its services grew and the scope of its projects expanded, the firm was formally upgraded to a Limited Liability Company, becoming Losos-4 Consultants Ltd., duly registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission of Nigeria (RC 1539440) under the Companies and Allied Matters Decree.

Motivation for Establishment

Losos-4 was established in response to growing concerns within the construction and engineering industry regarding non-compliance with engineering standards, poor design quality, and inadequate project execution. To address these gaps, a group of seasoned, highly experienced professional engineers came together under the leadership of Engr. Oni with a shared objective:
to set a higher standard for engineering consultancy practice through technical accuracy, professionalism, and integrity.

The firm was founded on the belief that sound engineering principles, rigorous design processes, and disciplined project management are essential to delivering safe, reliable, and sustainable infrastructure.

Growth & Key Milestones

Transitioned from a sole proprietorship to a Limited Liability Company, strengthening its corporate structure and capacity.

Built a multidisciplinary team of registered Mechanical, Electrical, and Fire Engineers, many with over 20–45 years of professional experience.

Successfully delivered and supervised large-scale institutional, commercial, hospitality, and industrial projects across Nigeria.

Established a strong reputation for engineering excellence, regulatory compliance, and dependable delivery.

Maintains current practicing licenses, professional registrations, and statutory compliance (COREN, NSE, BPP, ITF, NSITF, Pension, and CAC).

Expanded technical capability through collaboration with international partners in the United Kingdom.

Today, Losos-4 Consultants Ltd. stands as a fully independent, professionally driven engineering consultancy, committed to delivering world-class engineering services and setting benchmarks within the Nigerian engineering industry and beyond.
